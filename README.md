# DESolver-AI-Master

## Welcome to the AI Revolution in Computational Modeling

This repository contains a collection of rough-draft *mini-models* for **Tom Coleman's DESolver** developed using state-of-the-art language models, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Claude AI, and NotebookLM. 
These mini-models are written in the DESolver syntax, compatible with **HumMod**—a comprehensive framework for simulating integrative human physiology.
  
🎥 A video demonstration of model development is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOPwOKI7-h0&feature=youtu.be).

To download DESolver visit [Drew Pruett's HumMod Repository](https://github.com/HumMod) and look for minis-master.

## Purpose

These models are offered as open resources for public exploration and collaborative development. They showcase the unique potential of natural language-based AI in generating biologically plausible, mathematically structured models.

By harnessing the ability of large language models (LLMs) to interpret, synthesize, and express complex scientific ideas, we aim to:

- Accelerate scientific research **in silico** 
- Democratize access to computational modeling tools
- Foster open-science collaborations across disciplines

This initiative represents a small but significant step toward the next generation of research tools—where AI and scientists work hand-in-hand to uncover new insights in health, medicine, and systems biology.

**Markdown instructions used for AI training are included. They can be used as context files for the AI Assistants (in Claude AI for example) to understand how to generate DESolver mini-models. The instructions are in draft stages, generated from publically accessible documentat text converted into markdown.**
Seperate instructions have to be developed for large HumMod model as well.

## 🧠 AI-Generated Mini-Models

> **Models in this repository were co-produced by AI and reviewed for basic compliance with HumMod’s structure.**  
> These are *starting points*, not validated physiological simulations.

**List of Models:**
- Hair Growth (Claude AI and OpenAI versions) - Latest AI training used 
- High Pass Filter, same as Resistor Capacitor filter - used in electronics for signal processing 
- Sequoia Tree Growth - this one appears accurate, climate is being added - Latest AI Training used
- Water Heater - this was an attempt at thermodynamics - Old training OpenAI ChatGPT 
- Pressure Cooker - Explodes at certain pressure, the units are way off, earlier AI training used
- SandClock - Older AI training used
- Labour - for uterine contractions, this may not be the latest reiteration or the best one - Old AI training
