# DESolver-AI-Master

## Welcome to the AI Revolution in Computational Modeling

This repository contains a collection of rough-draft *mini-models* for **Tom Coleman's DESolver** developed using state-of-the-art language models, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Claude AI, and NotebookLM. 
These mini-models are written in the DESolver syntax, compatible with **HumMod**‚Äîa comprehensive framework for simulating integrative human physiology.
  
üé• A video demonstration of model development is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOPwOKI7-h0&feature=youtu.be).

To download DESolver visit [Drew Pruett's HumMod Repository](https://github.com/HumMod) and look for minis-master.

## Purpose

These models are offered as open resources for public exploration and collaborative development. They showcase the unique potential of natural language-based AI in generating biologically plausible, mathematically structured models.

By harnessing the ability of large language models (LLMs) to interpret, synthesize, and express complex scientific ideas, we aim to:

- Accelerate scientific discovery in **in silico physiology**
- Democratize access to computational modeling tools
- Foster open-science collaborations across disciplines

This initiative represents a small but significant step toward the next generation of research tools‚Äîwhere AI and scientists work hand-in-hand to uncover new insights in health, medicine, and systems biology.

## üß† AI-Generated Mini-Models

> **Models in this repository were co-produced by AI and reviewed for basic compliance with HumMod‚Äôs structure.**  
> These are *starting points*, not validated physiological simulations.

**List of Models:**
- Hair Growth (Claude AI and OpenAI versions) - Latest AI training used 
- High Pass Filter, same as Resistor Capacitor filter - used in electronics for signal processing 
- Sequoia Tree Growth - this one appears accurate, climate is being added - Latest AI Training used
- Water Heater - this was an attempt at thermodynamics - Old training OpenAI ChatGPT 
- Pressure Cooker - Explodes at certain pressure, the units are way off, earlier AI training used
- SandClock - Older AI training used
- Labour - for uterine contractions, this may not be the latest reiteration or the best one - Old AI training
