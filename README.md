# DESolver-AI-Master

**Welcome to the AI Revolution in Computational Physiology**

This repository contains a collection of rough-draft *mini-models* developed using state-of-the-art language models, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Claude AI, and NotebookLM. These mini-models are written in the DESolver syntax, compatible with **HumMod**‚Äîa comprehensive framework for simulating integrative human physiology.
  
üé• A video demonstration of model development is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOPwOKI7-h0&feature=youtu.be).


## Purpose

These models are offered as open resources for public exploration and collaborative development. They showcase the unique potential of natural language-based AI in generating biologically plausible, mathematically structured models.

By harnessing the ability of large language models (LLMs) to interpret, synthesize, and express complex scientific ideas, we aim to:

- Accelerate scientific discovery in **in silico physiology**
- Democratize access to computational modeling tools
- Foster open-science collaborations across disciplines

This initiative represents a small but significant step toward the next generation of research tools‚Äîwhere AI and scientists work hand-in-hand to uncover new insights in health, medicine, and systems biology.
